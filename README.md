# wpseo-category-pages
This extension to Yoast SEO makes it possible to create custom category archive pages (content hubs).

The plugin only does something if you already use the removal of the category prefix in the Yoast settings:
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpseo_titles#top#taxonomies

This results in a more SEO-friendly URL. But futhermore, this plugin allows you to link to any page/post with the bare category URL. Making it even more SEO-friendly.

To overwrite the standard rewrite rules for category archives. Go to the category, and check the checkbox at the bottom. Now create a custom page or post with the same slug as the category archive would have had.
